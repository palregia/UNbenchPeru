      "statement": "We are always interested to inform the Security Council of the Sudan’s position on the various questions raised that are related to its interests. At the outset, I would like to thank the Council for the spirit of cooperation and consensus that enabled it today to adopt resolution 2416 (2018) on the extension of the mandate of the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA) for six months. I also reaffirm the commitment of my country to cooperate with UNISFA and to enable it to implement its mandate as per Council resolution 1990 (2011). The security and stability in Abyei, along with the progress in fostering peaceful coexistence between the Misseriya and Ngok Dinka communities, result from the concerted efforts of our Government and the positive role played by UNISFA since its establishment. We stress that all parties must continue to work together to enhance security and stability until the final status of Abyei is defined."
